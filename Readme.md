# DeepCSAT – E-commerce Customer Satisfaction Predictor 🤖

A deep learning project that predicts Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores using customer feedback text and numeric service metrics.

## 🧠 Overview
This project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model built with TensorFlow/Keras to analyze e-commerce customer interactions and feedback.  
The model predicts CSAT scores (1–5) and provides real-time insights via a Streamlit web app.

## ⚙️ Run the App
```bash
streamlit run deepcsat_app.py
